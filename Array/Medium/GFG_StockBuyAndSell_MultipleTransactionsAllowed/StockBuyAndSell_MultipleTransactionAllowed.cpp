-----------------------------------------------------------
Problem Statement:
The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock i at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.
Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Approach:
Instead of finding the exact pair (lowest buy, highest sell) for each upward trend, simply collect every local increase â€” i.e., if prices[i] > prices[i-1], and add the difference to total profit. The idea is mathematically sound and logically equivalent to timing perfect buy/sell points within each upward slope.
