Problem Statement:
You are given a positive integer n, you need to add all the digits of n and create a new number. Perform this operation until the resultant number has only one digit in it. Return the final number obtained after performing the given operation.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Approach:
First checked if the number is zero, in which case returned zero directly. Otherwise used the digital root property where a number and the sum of its digits leave the same remainder when divided by 9. This means n % 9 gives the same result as repeatedly adding digits. But for multiples of 9 this comes out as 0 while the digital root should be 9, so the formula is adjusted to 1 + (n - 1) % 9. The order of the digits doesnâ€™t matter because powers of 10 reduce to 1 when divided by 9, so each digit just contributes its own value regardless of position, making the remainder depend only on the sum of digits.
